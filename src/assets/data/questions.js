Unlike fixed-width data types, which have a predetermined number of bits or digits, arbitrary precision format uses dynamic data structures to store individual digits, allowing for precise calculations with numbers of any size. It enables accurate computations in applications where precision and range are essential, albeit with increased computational overhead compared to fixed-width types.",
